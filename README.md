# R Foundations 2024 (Oct-Nov)

The website and slides for the R Foundations 2024 course, from the Statistics Department at the University of Warwick, developed and taught by [Ella Kaye](https://warwick.ac.uk/ellakaye).

This course is primarily aimed at first year Statistics PhD students. It has been developed as a prerequisite for those attending the [Academy for PhD Training in Statistics (APTS)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/apts/) to cover the R material thatâ€™s required for those modules.

Students and staff at the University of Warwick have the opportunity to take this course in-person in Term 1, and can register to attend by filling out the [join form](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/kaye/r-foundations-2024/).

For students at other universities attending APTS, working through the content should give you a sufficient grounding to prepare for the R component of the APTS modules. 

This website is built from the [warwickcourse](https://github.com/warwick-stats-resources/warwickcourse) template.
