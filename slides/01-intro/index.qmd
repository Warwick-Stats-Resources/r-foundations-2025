::: notes
R is distributed with fifteen "base packages": base, compiler, datasets, grDevices, graphics, grid, methods, parallel, splines, stats, stats4, tcltk, tools, translations, and utils.

In addition, there are fifteen "recommended packages" from CRAN which are included with binary distributions of R: KernSmooth, MASS, Matrix, boot, class, cluster, codetools, foreign, lattice, mgcv, nlme, nnet, rpart, spatial, and survival.

## The tidyverse

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar and data structures.

![From <https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/07/teaching-the-tidyverse-in-2020-part-1-getting-started/>](images/tidyverse-packages.png){fig-align="center"}

**tidyverse** 2.0.0. includes **lubridate** for date-times as well (not shown in image).

## `penguins` data

- Available in R >= 4.5.0

- Originally popularised in the [**palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package, as a great dataset for learning data exploration, visualisation and on which to practice statistical methodology.

-   It contains measurement data for 344 penguins, from three different species, collected from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

## The R community

Another reason to love R is the community around it.

It prides itself on being friendly, diverse, helpful, and supportive.

# Introducing RStudio {.coral-bg}

## At first

![](images/new-RStudio-project.png)

## With script

![](images/RStudio-project-with-script.png) [RStudio cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rstudio-ide.html)

## Best practice: use R projects

An RStudio project is a contect for working on a specific project

-   Keeps files well-organised

-   Automatically sets working directory to project root

-   Has separate workspace and command history

-   Works well with version control via git or svn

## Getting started with projects

-   Create a project from a new or existing directory via the file menu or new project button

-   Switch project, or open a different project in a new RStudio instance via the project menu

## RStudio project demo

-   Create R-Foundations project

-   Create first script

## Using the console

-   For things that only need doing once, e.g. installing packages

-   For doing things you don't need to track, e.g. requesting help files

-   To quickly explore new ideas before adding them to a script

## Using the console: shortcuts

RStudio provides a few shortcuts to help write code in the R console

-   <kbd title = "up arrow">↑</kbd>/<kbd title = "down arrow">↓</kbd> go back/forward through history one command at a time
-   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd title = "command">⌘</kbd> + <kbd title = "up arrow">↑</kbd> review recent history and select command
-   <kbd>Tab</kbd> view possible completions for part-written expression

Code completion (using <kbd>Tab</kbd>) is also provided in the source editor

## Using the console: demo

``` r
1 + 1
?log
log(10)
exp(-4 * 4 / 2) / sqrt(2 * pi)
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("palmerpenguins") # Only if using R < 4.5.0
```

## Using scripts

Text files saved with an .R suffix are recognised as R code

Code can be sent directly from a script to the console as follows:

-   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd title = "command">⌘</kbd> + <kbd title = "enter">↵</kbd> or <img src="images/run_button.png" alt="Run button" height="50px" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> run current line
    -   Run multiple lines by selecting first
-   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd title = "command">⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd title = "enter">↵</kbd> or <img src="images/source_button.png" alt="Source button" height="50px" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>
    -   Run the script from start to finish.

## Why R scripts?

Writing an R script for an analysis has several advantages over a graphical user interface (GUI)

-   It provides a record of the exact approach used in an analysis
-   It enables the analysis to be easily reproduced and modified
-   It allows greater control

## Good practice for R Scripts

Organising your R script well will help you and others understand and use it.

-   Add comment or two at start to describe purpose of script
    -   Use one or more `#` to start a comment
-   Load required data and packages at the start
-   Avoid hard-coding: define variables such as file paths early on
-   Give functions and variable meaningful names
-   use `###` or `#---` to separate sections (in RStudio Code \> Insert Section)

## Installing packages

*In console*

-   Install a package with `install.packages("package_name")`

    -   Watch out for the plural!

-   Install multiple packages with `install.packages(c("package1", "package2"))`

    -   The `c()` function creates a vector

-   Or use install button in packages pane:

![](images/install_packages.png){width="400" fig-align="center"}

## Loading packages

*In script*

-   Load packages with `library(package_name)`

## Your turn

-   Create an R project called "r-foundations"

-   Install the **tidyverse** package, and **palmerpenguins** if using R < 4.5.0

-   Find the help page for the `penguins` dataset

-   Find the help page for the `filter` function in the `dplyr` package

-   Experiment typing commands into the console or in an R script.

## R script demo

``` r
### load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins) # Only if R < 4.5

### Inspect data (base R functions)
View(penguins)
head(penguins)
summary(penguins)

### tidyverse functions

## The data

::: smaller90

```{r}
penguins
```

:::

## datasets::penguins vs palmerpenguins::penguins

```{r}
colnames(penguins)
```


```{r}
colnames(palmerpenguins::penguins)
```

. . .

| datasets      | palmerpenguins      |
|---------------|---------------------|
| `bill_len`    | `bill_length_mm`    |
| `bill_dep`    | `bill_depth_mm`     |
| `flipper_len` | `flipper_length_mm` |
| `body_mass`   | `body_mass_g `      |

## How many of each species?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
count(penguins, species)
```

## How many of each species on each island?

```{r}
count(penguins, species, island, .drop = FALSE)
```

## Show me the bill dimensions of the 5 heaviest female Gentoo penguins

```{r}
penguins |>
  filter(sex == "female",
         species == "Gentoo") |>
  slice_max(body_mass, n = 5) |>
  select(contains("bill"))
  
```

## The native pipe

`|>` is a pipe.

It passes what comes before into the first argument of what comes after.

Pipes are a powerful tool for clearly expressing a sequence of multiple operations.

We'll talk more about pipes in the data wrangling session.

## What's the mean bill length, by species?

```{r}
penguins |>
  summarise(mean_bill_length = mean(bill_len, na.rm = TRUE),
            .by = species)
```

## What's the relationship between bill length and depth? {.smaller80}

           group = species)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, 
                 shape = species),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(color = species)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(title = "Penguin bill dimensions",
       subtitle = "Positive correlation between bill length and depth for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
       x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = rel(0.95)))
```

### what?!

This is an illustration of [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox){target="_blank"}.

> Simpson's paradox is a phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.

# Getting help in R {.green-bg}

## Within R: Help with functions

```{r eval = FALSE}
# help with a specific function
help(function_name)
?function_name

# quick reminder of the function arguments
arg(function_name)

# see an example
example(function_name)

# see the source code
## in console
function_name
## in View pane (easier to read, syntax highlighting)
View(function_name)
```

## Within R: `help.search`

```{r eval = FALSE}
# when ?function_name fails (e.g. don't have package loaded)
help.search("function_name") # note quotation marks
??function_name

# for when you can't quite remember the function name
??something_like_function_name

# R help start page
help.start()
## note that using the RStudio Help home button gives even more resources
```

## Within R: Help with package

```{r eval = FALSE}
# `help`
help(package = "package_name")
# Help panel in RStudio will give links to all documentation
# and help pages for that package

# find/browse vignettes for installed (or specific) packages
browseVignettes()
browseVignettes("package_name")

# use auto-completion in RStudio to see what functions 
# are in a package
?package::
```
