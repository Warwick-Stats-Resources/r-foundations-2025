title: "R Foundations 2025"
---

Welcome to the R Foundations course for 2025!

This course is primarily aimed at first year Statistics PhD students. It has been developed as a prerequisite for those attending the [Academy for PhD Training in Statistics (APTS)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/apts/) to cover the R material thatâ€™s required for those modules.

The course is also suitable for doctoral students and post-docs across other departments, and open to all interested members of the university, space permitting.

For students at other universities attending APTS, working through the content should give you a sufficient grounding to prepare for the R component of the APTS modules. 

## Syllabus overview

We cover an introduction to R and RStudio; Data types, structures, and data wrangling using the tidyverse; programming in R; simulation and optimisation; graphics (both base and ggplot2), and Quarto.

All slides and further resources can be accessed from the [content](content.qmd) page and also via the [schedule](schedule.qmd).
