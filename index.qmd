title: "R Foundations 2024"

Welcome to the R Foundations course for 2024!

This course is primarily aimed at first year Statistics PhD students. It has been developed as a prerequisite for those attending the [Academy for PhD Training in Statistics (APTS)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/apts/) to cover the R material thatâ€™s required for those modules.

Students and staff at the University of Warwick have the opportunity to take this course in-person in Term 1. See the schedule for dates. Details for signing up will be sent round through Department of Statistics mailing lists. 

For students at other universities attending APTS, working through the content should give you a sufficient grounding to prepare for the R component of the APTS modules. 

## Syllabus overview

We cover an introduction to R and RStudio; Data types, structures, and data wrangling using the tidyverse; programming in R; simulation and optimisation; graphics (both base and ggplot2), and Quarto.

All slides and further resources can be accessed from the [content](content.qmd) page and also via the [schedule](schedule.qmd).
